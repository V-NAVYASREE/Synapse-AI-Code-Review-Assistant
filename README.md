Synapse AI Code Reviewer
Developed by: Navyasree

üåü Project Objective
This project successfully implements a full-stack, AI-powered Code Review Assistant designed to automate the process of evaluating source code quality. It meets all core requirements of the placement assignment and incorporates several critical optional features to deliver a robust and submission-ready application.

The application allows users to upload any source code file (e.g., .py, .js, etc.) and instantly receive a highly structured review report generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture
This application utilizes a modern microservice architecture built for stability and speed.

Core Technologies Used
Backend / API (FastAPI - Python): Chosen for its high performance, asynchronous capabilities, and automatic data validation using Pydantic. It handles all LLM communication and database transactions.

Frontend (React.js): Provides a responsive, interactive Single Page Application (SPA) experience with a polished, dark-themed UI.

LLM Integration (LiteLLM + OpenRouter): LiteLLM acts as a universal API layer, using the single OpenRouter key to access top-tier, structured models (like GPT-4o) with reliability.

Database (SQLite + SQLAlchemy): A zero-configuration, file-based database used for persistent storage of all review reports.

PDF Reporting (ReportLab): A Python industry-standard library used for server-side PDF generation, guaranteeing clean, reliable, black-on-white documents.

‚ú® Features and Deliverables
The application delivers a complete solution that exceeds the base scope of work:

A. Core Functionality and Quality
Structured LLM Analysis: Uses precise prompt engineering to enforce structured JSON output, ensuring the report is consistently categorized into key areas like modularity, readability, performance, and potential bugs.

Backend API: Provides clean REST endpoints for review (POST /api/review), history retrieval (GET /api/history), and report deletion (DELETE /api/review/{id}).

Cross-Platform UI: The frontend is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

B. Exceeding Scope (Optional Features)
Review History & Persistence: All generated reports are immediately saved to the local reviews.db database, fulfilling the optional storage requirement.

Interactive Dashboard: The Review History tab acts as an interactive dashboard, allowing users to search, filter, and easily expand/collapse reports.

Guaranteed PDF Export: Users can download any saved report as a professional, server-generated PDF file.

Data Management: The history interface includes a Delete function to manage and remove old reports from the database.

üöÄ Setup and Run Instructions
This project requires Python 3.10+ (for the backend) and Node.js/npm (for the frontend).

1. Project Structure
The repository follows a clean separation of concerns:

code-review-assistant/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/            (FastAPI, DB, LLM Logic)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/           (React UI)

2. LLM API Key Setup (Crucial)
The reviewer must create a file named .env in the backend/ directory with their OpenRouter key:

OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" 
#please use your own token here

3. Backend (FastAPI) Installation
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Install Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the API server:

uvicorn app:app --reload

4. Frontend (React) Installation
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Install Node dependencies:

npm install

Start the React development server:

npm start
